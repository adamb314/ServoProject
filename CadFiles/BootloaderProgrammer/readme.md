This model allows you to 3d print a jig that makes it easier to connect the programmer to each board you wish to flash the bootloader to.

Pogo pins I used: 
`P50-B1`

Resin Printer I used: 
`elegoo mars 2 pro`

other notes: 
- if you want to use a fdm 3d printer pogo pin hole diameter may need to be increased. Model has extra holes for testing out what the ideal size is for your printer. 

Here are two quick videos showing the 3d printed bootloader programmer jig:
